/*
Composition
Definition: Composition is a "strong" has-a relationship where one class owns another class, and the contained object cannot exist without the container. It implies a stricter "part-of" relationship with full ownership.
Lifecycle: The contained objectâ€™s lifecycle is tied to the container. If the container is destroyed, the contained object is destroyed too.
Example: A House and Room relationship. A room is part of a house, and if the house is demolished, the room no longer exists.

Key Point: The Room object is created inside the House class, showing that Room is fully dependent on House.
